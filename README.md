# scrabbletypegame
Scrabble type game written in Java

 I was looking for a "Scrabble" type game that can run on linux. I figured Java would be a good bet. I stumbled across this code on sourceforge and it was great but would time out because it is a demo version.  I contacted the author via email Mariusz Bernacek to register the game. Mr. Bernacek said he no longer maintains it and he misplaced the code. When I told him about this he seemed to think it wasn't the full professional version of the code.
Mariusz did give me permission to play with the code and post it here on GitHub. My goal is to get this compliling inside a platform like IntelliJ. Maybe make some modern updates. Remove any trademark conflicts. And maybe I can learn a little more Java skills from the community.

## Building

The project uses Maven with a standard layout. To compile run:

```bash
mvn package
```

This will produce a runnable JAR in `target/`.

The built JAR bundles all the images along with the dictionary and lexicon
files, so no additional data files are needed to run the game.
